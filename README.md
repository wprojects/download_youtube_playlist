# Get all songs from youtube playlist

Install libraries:
Go to terminal and enter this in the folder the file is in:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Set what folder you want the files to download to by setting your path inside the script example: folder_path = "~/Songs"

Grab the id at the end of the playlist youtube link and put it in the "playlist_id" variable inside the script to tell the script which playlist to download! For example, the playlist ID for this one is the highlighted part in the screenshot.
